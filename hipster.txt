If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Heyyyyy campers! No, Pop-pop does not get a treat. I just bought you a f**king pizza. In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive.
Fun and failure both start out the same way. I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Happy. I've made a huge tiny mistake. I hear the jury's still out on science. Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual intercourse. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass! I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me!

Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. But I'm the oldest. The matriarch if you will. He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one. There's a girl in my soup!
